# rock_paper_scissors

This will be my first major project on The Odin Project. Ultimately, I want the user to be able to play rock-paper-scissors with an AI bot that will learn patterns from the user's playstyle. There will be a UI for the player to select and confirm their choice, and a scorekeeper that will show wins/losses and other relevant statistics.

Not sure what's the best way to keep track of progress, so I'm just going to go with a checklist of things that I need done, then a section below that with entry points of updates. inb4 scope creep.

TO-DO:

[ ] Basic Rock Paper Scissors logic
[ ] UI: selection buttons for the player
[ ] UI: win/loss tracker
[ ] UI: reset button that will reset the current tally of points (AI remains same)
[ ] UI: reset button that will reset the training of the AI
[ ] AI training algorithm (DNN model reinforcement learning)

UPDATE: July 28, 2022

Set up basic stuff, put my head down, and get started building.
